/**
 * Settings rows and check rows, in the same layout as hampel/console-report's ReportsSettings and
 * RendersChecks - which this cannot use, because that package needs PHP 8.3. The reason is one
 * function: it pads with mb_str_pad(), native only from 8.3, and XenForo does not ship the
 * polyfill that supplies it below that. XenForo's own symfony/console is not the obstacle; it
 * satisfies the package's constraint.
 *
 * The four check outcomes mean what they mean everywhere else: `[ ok ]` was proved, `[warn]` works
 * now and bites later, `[fail]` cannot do what it is configured to, and a blank marker did not
 * apply. A skip is never a pass.
 *
 * **Every name here is the package's**, where the package has one - checkSection(), checkOk() and
 * its siblings, checkResult(), checksFailed(), checksWarned(), checkExitCode(), detail(),
 * heading(), and the $check... properties - so a command written against this reads the same as
 * one written against the package, and moving to it would be a change of `use`. Keep it that way:
 * add to the package's vocabulary, do not rename it. Three things are not in the package: muted(),
 * probe() and errorLogPrefix(), which are XenForo's concerns; and checkExitCode()'s $strict.
 *
 * For a Symfony `Command`: probe() names the command in what it logs.
